# Nero Datalog

Nero is Joe's own dialect of the Datalog logic programming language.  Datalog
is often used as a query language for databases; Joe provides it as a means
of querying and transforming in-memory collections of data.

Joe provides Nero in three forms:

- As a standalone language, via the [`nero` application](../nero_app.md).
- As a language [embedded in Joe scripts](nero_and_joe.md)
- As an API [for use in Java code](nero_and_java.md)
